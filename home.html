    <h3>Define Home page?</h3>

    <p>A homepage is the main or front page of a website, typically the first page a visitor sees when accessing that website. It's designed to provide an overview of the website's content and purpose, and often includes links to other sections or pages. Think of it as the entry point or "front door" of a website. </p>
